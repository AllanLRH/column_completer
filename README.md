# Column completer for Pandas

Easily complete strings from columns in Pandas' DataFrames while using Jupyter â€” see the notebook for a good explanation.

This code contains a class which, once instantiated to a DataFrame, returns the column names as string corresponding to the attribute accessed with autocompletion.

It handles column names which contains spaces by replacing them with an underscore (`_`) as a default behaviour, but the replacement string can be altered upon the object instantiation.

The class definition also provides an easy way to rename the notebook columns.
